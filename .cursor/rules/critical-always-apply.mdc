# AMPLIFIED general rules. These are in general_code.md, but repeated for emphasis
- ASSUME you are writing production code, not tutorials for newbies
- NEVER add obvious comments. Comments should explain why not what
- prefer to inline single-use variables. Do not add intermediate variables unless they are reused, or help readability

# AMPLIFIED git rules. These are in git_helpers.md, but repeated for emphasis
- NEVER --no-verify
- NEVER add untracked files. The user will intentionally decide
- ALWAYS ask for permission before force pushing, pulling, or rebasing
- ALWAYS ask for permission before --amend. Adding to commit history is okay, and commits can be trash.

# Files to ALWAYS load
- load tools/prompts/general_code.md

# Claude code
- DO NOT EXECUTE CLAUDE CODE ANY OTHER WAY. If the user asks to run a task in claude code, use `claude -p "$someTaskPrompt" --output-format json`
